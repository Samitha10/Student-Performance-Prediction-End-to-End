## Introduction

Predicting student performance is crucial for educational institutions to identify students who may need additional support and to tailor educational programs to individual needs. This project leverages data-driven methods to predict student grades based on factors such as attendance, participation, and previous academic records.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment using a web application

## Technologies Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- HTML
- Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Web Framework: Flask

## Data

The dataset used for this project includes various features that influence student performance, such as attendance records, participation scores, previous grades, and socio-economic factors. The data is divided into raw and processed formats for better organization.

## Model Training

The model training process involves several steps:
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. Feature engineering: Creating new features that may help improve model performance.
3. Model selection: Trying different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the best hyperparameters for the chosen model.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score. Visualizations are also used to compare the predicted values against the actual values.

## Deployment

The trained model is deployed as a web application using Flask. Users can input new student data to get predictions on their expected performance.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the web application locally, execute:
```sh
python src/app.py
```
Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
